# Shopify
This is a full-stack e-commerce web application inspired by Shopify, developed during my Java Full Stack Developer internship. The platform enables users to browse products, manage their cart, place orders, and track shipments. It also includes admin functionalities to manage product listings, categories, and user orders.
